# master-mind-quantum-project

This version of master mind solver chooses a new guess everytime after shortening the list of candidates
Thus, this algorithm's run time complexity is much much faster than O(n)


NOTE: the algorithm can get stuck in infinite while loop, when that happens just ctrl + c and run again. But I assure you
most of the time it will find the secret key.

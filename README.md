# master-mind-quantum-project

This version of master mind solver chooses a new guess everytime after shortening the list of candidates
Thus, this algorithm's run time complexity is much much faster than O(n)

To try the solver you need to open the test.py file and enter your desired secret key, then just run the test.py file
using -> python test.py


NOTE: the algorithm can get stuck in an infinite while loop, when that happens just ctrl + c and run again. But I assure you
most of the time it will find the secret key.
